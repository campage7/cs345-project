Zero Knowledge Proof by Cameron Page & Franco Diaz

A Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a protocol where a statement can be verified as true (or not true) without revealing anything about the statement itself.

ZKPs can be used in authentication protocols to enable users to prove their identity or access rights without revealing sensitive information such as passwords or biometric data. This enhances security while maintaining user privacy.

ZKPs enable parties to prove the truth of a statement or the possession of certain information without revealing any additional information beyond the validity of the statement itself.

ZKPs can sometimes offer more efficient solutions compared to traditional cryptographic methods. For example, they can enable secure multiparty computation with lower communication and computational overhead, making them suitable for resource-constrained environments.
